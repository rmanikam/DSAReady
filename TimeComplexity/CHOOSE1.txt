Q) Which of the following is not bounded by O(n^2)?

Ans) n^3 / (sqrt(n))

Let's analyze each of the given expressions to determine which one is not bounded by 

O(n2).

Expression: 
(15^10)×n+12099

This expression is linear in n. The term (15 ^ 10)×n dominates, and (15 ^ 10) is a constant. Therefore, this expression grows as 
O(n), which is bounded by O(n^2).
Expression: 

n 
1.98
 

This expression grows as n ^ 1.98, which is less than O(n^2). Therefore, it is bounded by 
O(n^2).

Expression: 
n^3
 
Simplifying 
n^3/ sqrt n, we get n ^ 2.5. This expression grows faster than n^2, so it is not bounded by 
O(n^2).

Expression: 
(2^20)×n

This expression is linear in n. The term (2^20) is a constant, so the growth rate is 
O(n), which is bounded by O(n^2).
